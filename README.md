# AndroidRules

Android Rules is a simple yet powerful Java rules engine, compatible with the Android OS, providing the following features:

- Lightweight framework and easy to learn API
- Useful abstractions to programatically define business rules and apply them easily
- Forward-chaining breadth-first rule evaluation. Forward chaining is a popular implementation strategy for expert systems, business and production rule systems.
